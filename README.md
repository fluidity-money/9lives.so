# 9Lives

9Lives is an Arbitrum Stylus smart contract implemented with a simple factory/pair
pattern. A factory takes a list of outcomes, and creates a variable number of contracts
with a minimal viable proxy pointing to share ERC20s, and a trading contract.

It allows a protocol-sanctioned address to determine which outcome came to reality,
then share holders can convert their positions to fUSDC on request.
